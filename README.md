# Binary-Search-Trees
The goal of this project is to compare the Binary Search Tree with a traditional unsorted array data structure, both implemented in Java, using a real-world application to read in and provide access to Cape Town's load shedding data.


LSArrayApp  read in the attached text file and store the data items within a traditional array (a single array of objects). 
it has methods:
printAreas (stage, day, startTime) -  to print out the list of areas for the first matching combination of the supplied parameters that is found; or "Areas not found" if there is no match.

& 

printAllAreas () - to print out the areas for every stage, day and start time, in any order. 

LSBSTApp does the same thing but instead of traditional array it uses BST

Using part2 and part 4  discretely count the number of comparison operations (<, >, =) you are performing in the code.  Only count where you are comparing the keys.
