# Binary-Search-Trees
The goal of this project is to compare the Binary Search Tree with a traditional unsorted array data structure, both implemented in Java


LSArrayApp  read in the attached text file and store the data items within a traditional array (a single array of objects),discretely count the number of comparison operations (<, >, =) you are performing in the code.  Only count where you are comparing the keys.

LSBSTApp does the same thing but instead of traditional array it uses BST
